- **Bạn đã làm việc với hooks chưa và bạn biết gì về hooks trong react**
    - Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It **allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class**
    - Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.
    - It includes the basic hooks provided by reactJS such as useState, ... and custom hooks that are self-defined hooks for our own purposes.
    - the two general rules to follow with Hooks:
        - **Only call Hooks at the *top level***
        - **Only call Hooks from React functions or custom hooks**
- **useMemo ≠ useCallback**
    - `useMemo` is to memoize a calculation result between a function's calls and between renders
    - `useCallback` is to memoize a callback itself (referential equality) between renders
    - `useRef` is to keep data between renders (updating does not fire re-rendering)
    - `useState` is to keep data between renders (updating will fire re-rendering)
    
    `useMemo` focuses on avoiding heavy calculation.
    
    `useCallback` focuses on a different thing: it fixes performance issues when inline event handlers like `onClick={() => { doSomething(...); }` cause `PureComponent` child re-rendering (because function expressions there are referentially different each time)
    
    This said, `useCallback` is closer to `useRef`, rather than a way to memoize a calculation result
    
    <aside>
    💡 `useCallback` will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the inputs has changed. This is useful *when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders*
     (e.g. shouldComponentUpdate)
    
    </aside>
    
- **Microservice**
    - Microservice is a new architecture that divides the project into many small services.
    - Each service will be independent of the other.
    - It is possible to have different architectures, use different technologies, or use different databases.
    - They communicate with each other through a network environment such as a restful API or a message queue
- **Monolithic**
    - Monolithic is the old architecture often used, it is a monolithic architecture, meaning all features will be in one project.
- **Redux**
    - Redux is a library that helps us manage states better. Instead of passing state through each Component, Redux will create a single store used to change data.
    - Redux include:
        - `Store` includes:
            - `State`: is the current data stored on the state
            - `Reducer`: is a function that converts old state into new state
            - Dispatcher: manage `middlewares` and pass data down to reducer.
        - `Action`: create actions used to describe user-generated events
        - `View`: display data provided by Store.
- middleware is a class between Reducers and Dispatch Actions, it will modify and be called before the action is dispatched. Commonly used in logging, reporting, async api, routing, …
- Redux-Saga is a redux middleware library that makes managing side effects in redux apps simpler. By taking full advantage of ES6's Generators (function*) feature, it allows us to write async code that looks like synchronous.
- **Context ?**
    - Context provides a method of passing data through the component tree without having to manually pass props through each level.
